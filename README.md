# iTunesStoreX
This tweak modifies the URL's during runtime, which can be resource intensive at times, that is why it is of best practice to pick the correct bundle to hook in the .plist file, as to not drain too much battery. 
This tweak can be adapted to hook basically any URL in ios =>6 (higher versions use NSURLSession, so this tweak might not yield the best result), and you may freely use this code as long as i am credited in your findings/releases.
